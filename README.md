# Order‑of‑Battle & Capability Assessment Lab

This repository holds the order‑of‑battle and capability assessment lab documents. The lab guides you through creating an all‑source capability assessment for a military or cyber actor. You will define a clear intelligence question, gather OSINT from official statements, procurement announcements, imagery, doctrine, and historical operations, and build a capability matrix. The process emphasises separating **capability** (what resources and systems exist) from **intent** (what the actor is likely to do).
